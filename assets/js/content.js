  Hi there! I'm a seasoned professional with over 10 years of
  experience in software development, technical support, and
  customer service. I've worked in various fields like education,
  transportation, and technology, where I've honed my
  problem-solving, communication, and presentation skills. I'm a
  team player who's always eager to learn. I recently completed the
  Activate Work Software Engineering bootcamp, where I gained
  hands-on experience and learned about the latest industry tools.
  I'm truly passionate about software engineering and have a deep
  understanding of programming, algorithms, and software design. I'm
  confident in my abilities to excel in software engineering, and
  I'm excited to bring my technical skills and problem-solving
  mindset to meaningful projects. I'm always open to new
  opportunities and thrive in dynamic and challenging work
  environments. Let's connect and explore how we can work together!

I'm working on this really cool ActivateWork Job Tracker app, which is all about helping students and job seekers keep track of opportunities.  But here's the thing: there are already some fantastic projects out there that do a great job with job tracking.</br>
				That got me thinking. What if I could add something unique, something that complements the Job Tracker app? That's where this chat app comes into play. By creating a real-time chat feature, I'm aiming to make communication and collaboration between users super smooth. Students could share advice, swap tips, and just connect in a more dynamic way.
